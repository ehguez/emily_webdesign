		<p class="space-before">When the chesty, fierce-furred bear becomes sick&nbsp;he&nbsp;travels the mountainsides and the fields, searching for&nbsp;certain grasses, flowers, leaves and&nbsp;herbs, that hold within themselves the power of&nbsp;healing. He eats, he grows stronger.</p><p><em class="italic">Could you, oh clever one, do this? Do you know anything about where you live, what if offers?</em> Have&nbsp;you ever said, “Sir Bear, teach me. I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a&nbsp;customer of death coming, and would give&nbsp;you a&nbsp;pot of honey and my house on&nbsp;the western hills to know what you know?”</p>
      
		<p class="right-aligned" id="right-aligned-space-before">After the water thrush, there&nbsp;was&nbsp;only&nbsp;silence.</p>

		<p class="space-before">Understand from the first this certainty. Butterflies don’t write books, neither do lilies, or&nbsp;violets.</p> <p>Which doesn’t mean they don’t know, in&nbsp;their&nbsp;own way, what they are. That they don’t&nbsp;know they are alive&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;that they don’t feel, that action upon which all&nbsp;consciousness sits, lightly or&nbsp;heavily.</p> <p>Humility is the prize of the leaf-world. Vainglory&nbsp;is&nbsp;the bane of us, the humans.</p>
		
		<img src="img/growth-4.png" id="growth-4-img"><p class="right-aligned">Sometimes the desire to be lost again, as&nbsp;long ago, comes over me like a vapor.</p><p class="right-aligned">With growth into adulthood, responsibilities claimed me, so&nbsp;many heavy coats. I&nbsp;didn’t&nbsp;choose&nbsp;them, I&nbsp;don’t fault them, but it took time to&nbsp;reject&nbsp;them.</p> 

		<p class="space-before">Now in the spring I kneel, I put my face into&nbsp;the packets of&nbsp;violets, the&nbsp;dampness, the&nbsp;freshness, the sense of&nbsp;ever-ness. Something is&nbsp;wrong, I&nbsp;know it, if&nbsp;I&nbsp;don’t keep my&nbsp;attention on&nbsp;eternity.</p> <p>May I be the tiniest nail in the house of&nbsp;the&nbsp;universe, tiny but useful. May&nbsp;I&nbsp;stay forever&nbsp;in the stream. May&nbsp;I&nbsp;look down upon the&nbsp;windflower and the bull thistle and the coreopsis with the greatest respect.</p>
		
       	<p class="right-aligned" id="asterix"><em>***</em></p>
		<p>Teach the children.<br>We don’t matter so much, <br>but the children do.</p> <p>Show them daisies and the pale hepatica. Teach&nbsp;them&nbsp;the taste of&nbsp;sassafras and wintergreen. The&nbsp;lives of&nbsp;the&nbsp;blue sailors, mallow, sunbursts, the&nbsp;moccasin-flowers. And the frisky ones&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;inkberry, lamb’s-quarters, blueberries. And the aromatic ones;&mdash;&#8202;rosemary, oregano. </p><p>Give them peppermint to put in their pockets as&nbsp;they go to school. Give them the fields and&nbsp;the&nbsp;woods and the possibility of the world salvaged from the lords of&nbsp;profit.</p> <p>Stand them in&nbsp;the stream, head them upstream, rejoice as&nbsp;they learn to love this green space they live in,&nbsp;its sticks and leaves and then the silent, beautiful blossoms.</p>
