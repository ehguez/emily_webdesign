    	<h5>MILL WORKER DRESS</h5>
    	<p>Early colonists in America were in close contact with England and, until the Revolution, clothing trends came directly from London. Fashion at this time was not merely for pleasure—it was a way of reinforcing social order. Clothing was a way to communicate one’s class, and dressing “according to the fashion and the time” was thought to be a moral good. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		  As in England, many colonies passed laws to&nbsp;attempt to enforce appropriate dress codes: restricting what the lower classes could wear, but&nbsp;also setting “sumptuary” laws for the upper classes which dictated that one should have a minimum estate of £200 to buy and wear “sumptuous” fine clothes. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
	   	The colonies were becoming increasingly rich&nbsp;as a result of the rum, sugar, cocoa and—most&nbsp;significantly— the slave trade, and the&nbsp;upper&nbsp;classes started foregoing durable, working clothes in favor of fine wools, velvets and imported silks. This trend toward increasingly lavish clothing, though seen as morally corrupting by puritan leaders (and, likely, as a threat to the Crown and structure of English society), continued to grow as wealth grew, up until the revolution.</p>

    	<h5>Fashion Babies</h5>
    	<p id="inverse">Before magazines became available in the mid­-1800s, women in the colonies had to find creative ways to stay current of trends. The main way they did this was through fashion babies: dolls that were made in Paris by patternmakers designing the latest clothing trends, and then sent to the colonies via London. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
