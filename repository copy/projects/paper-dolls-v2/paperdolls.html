Hello <em id="em-archibald">Archibald</em> Violet, and <em id="em-clarissa">clarissa</em> Bluebell. Hello <em id="lilian">Lilian</em> Willow, and&nbsp;<em id="em-noah">Noah</em>, the oak tree I have hugged and kissed every first day of&nbsp;spring for the last thirty years. And&nbsp;in reply its thousand of leaves tremble!<p class="space-before"> <em class="italic">What a life is ours!</em></p><p>Doesn’t anybody in the world anymore want to&nbsp;<em class="italic">get&nbsp;up&nbsp;in the middle of the night and sing?</em></p>

		
		<img src="img/in-the-beginning.png" id="beginning-img"><p class="right-aligned">In the beginning I was so young and&nbsp;such a&nbsp;stranger to&nbsp;myself I&nbsp;hardly&nbsp;existed. </p><p class="right-aligned">I had to go out into the world and see it&nbsp;and hear&nbsp;it&nbsp;and react to it, before&nbsp;I&nbsp;knew at all who I was, what I&nbsp;was, what&nbsp;I&nbsp;wanted&nbsp;to&nbsp;be </p>

		<p class="space-before">Wordsworth studied himself and found the&nbsp;subject astonishing. Actually what he&nbsp;studied&nbsp;was&nbsp;his relationship to the harmonies of&nbsp;the natural world. That’s what created the&nbsp;excitement.</p>

		<p class="right-aligned">I walk, all day, across the heaven-verging&nbsp;field. And&nbsp;whoever thinks these&nbsp;are&nbsp;worthy, breathy words I&nbsp;am&nbsp;writing&nbsp;down is kind. 

		<p class="space-before">Writing is neither vibrant life nor docile artifact but a text that would put all its money on the hope of suggestion. <em class="italic">Come with me into the field of&nbsp;sunflowers</em> is a better line than anything you will find here, and the sunflowers themselves far more wonderful than any words about them.</p>

		
       	<img src="img/growth-1.png" id="growth-1-img"><p class="right-aligned">
		<p class="right-aligned">I walked, all one spring day, upstream, sometimes in the midst of the ripples, sometimes along the shore. </p><p class="right-aligned">My company were violets, Dutchman’s&nbsp;breeches, spring&nbsp;beauties, trilliums, bloodroot, ferns rising so&nbsp;curled one could feel the upward push&nbsp;of the delicate hairs upon&nbsp;their&nbsp;bodies.</p> <p class="right-aligned">My&nbsp;parents were downstream, not&nbsp;far&nbsp;away, then farther away because I&nbsp;was walking the wrong way, upstream instead of&nbsp;downstream.<p class="right-aligned">Finally I was advertised on&nbsp;the hot-line of help, and&nbsp;yet&nbsp;there&nbsp;I was, slopping along happily in&nbsp;the&nbsp;stream’s coolness. So&nbsp;maybe it was the right way&nbsp;after all. </p><img src="img/growth-2.png" id="growth-2-img"><p class="right-aligned"><em class="italic" id="right-aligned-italic">If this was lost, let us all be lost always.</em></p><p class="right-aligned">The beech leaves were just slipping their&nbsp;copper coats; pale green and quivering they arrived into the year.</p><p class="right-aligned"> My&nbsp;heart opened, and opened again.</p> <p class="right-aligned">The water pushed against my effort, then&nbsp;its glassy permission to step ahead touched my ankles. The&nbsp;sense of going toward the source.</p>
		<img src="img/growth-3.png" id="growth-3-img">
		<p class="right-aligned">I do not think that I ever, in fact, returned&nbsp;home.</p>

		<p class="space-before">Do you think there is anything not attached by&nbsp;its&nbsp;unbreakable cord to everything else?</p><p class="space-before">Plant your peas and your corn in the field when&nbsp;the&nbsp;moon&nbsp;is full, or risk failure. This has been understood since planting&nbsp;began.</p> <p>The attention of the seed to the draw of&nbsp;the&nbsp;moon&nbsp;is,&nbsp;I&nbsp;suppose, measurable, like the&nbsp;tilt of&nbsp;the&nbsp;planet. Or,&nbsp;maybe not&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;maybe you have to&nbsp;add some immeasurable ingredient made of&nbsp;the&nbsp;hour, the singular field, the hand of&nbsp;the&nbsp;sower.</p>
		
       	<img src="img/black-oak.png" id="black-oak-img">
		<p>It lives in my imagination strongly that the black oak&nbsp;is pleased to be a black oak.</p><p>I mean all of them,<br> but in particular one tree that&nbsp;leads me into Blackwater, that is as shapely as a flower, that I&nbsp;have often hugged and&nbsp;put my&nbsp;lips&nbsp;to.</p><p>Maybe it is a hundred years old. And who knows what it dreamed of in the first springs of&nbsp;its&nbsp;life, escaping the cottontail’s teeth and everything dangerous else. Who knows when supreme patience took hold, and the wind’s wandering among its leaves was enough of&nbsp;motion, of&nbsp;travel?</p>

		<p class="right-aligned" id="right-aligned-space-before">Little by little I waded from&nbsp;the&nbsp;region of coltsfoot to&nbsp;the&nbsp;spring beauties.</p><p class="right-aligned">From there to&nbsp;the trilliums.<br> From there to&nbsp;the&nbsp;bloodroot.<br>Then the dark ferns. Then the wild music&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;waterthrush.</p>

		<p class="space-before">When the chesty, fierce-furred bear becomes sick&nbsp;he&nbsp;travels the mountainsides and the fields, searching for&nbsp;certain grasses, flowers, leaves and&nbsp;herbs, that hold within themselves the power of&nbsp;healing. He eats, he grows stronger.</p><p><em class="italic">Could you, oh clever one, do this? Do you know anything about where you live, what if offers?</em> Have&nbsp;you ever said, “Sir Bear, teach me. I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a&nbsp;customer of death coming, and would give&nbsp;you a&nbsp;pot of honey and my house on&nbsp;the western hills to know what you know?”</p>
      
		<p class="right-aligned" id="right-aligned-space-before">After the water thrush, there&nbsp;was&nbsp;only&nbsp;silence.</p>

		<p class="space-before">Understand from the first this certainty. Butterflies don’t write books, neither do lilies, or&nbsp;violets.</p> <p>Which doesn’t mean they don’t know, in&nbsp;their&nbsp;own way, what they are. That they don’t&nbsp;know they are alive&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;that they don’t feel, that action upon which all&nbsp;consciousness sits, lightly or&nbsp;heavily.</p> <p>Humility is the prize of the leaf-world. Vainglory&nbsp;is&nbsp;the bane of us, the humans.</p>
		
		<img src="img/growth-4.png" id="growth-4-img"><p class="right-aligned">Sometimes the desire to be lost again, as&nbsp;long ago, comes over me like a vapor.</p><p class="right-aligned">With growth into adulthood, responsibilities claimed me, so&nbsp;many heavy coats. I&nbsp;didn’t&nbsp;choose&nbsp;them, I&nbsp;don’t fault them, but it took time to&nbsp;reject&nbsp;them.</p> 

		<p class="space-before">Now in the spring I kneel, I put my face into&nbsp;the packets of&nbsp;violets, the&nbsp;dampness, the&nbsp;freshness, the sense of&nbsp;ever-ness. Something is&nbsp;wrong, I&nbsp;know it, if&nbsp;I&nbsp;don’t keep my&nbsp;attention on&nbsp;eternity.</p> <p>May I be the tiniest nail in the house of&nbsp;the&nbsp;universe, tiny but useful. May&nbsp;I&nbsp;stay forever&nbsp;in the stream. May&nbsp;I&nbsp;look down upon the&nbsp;windflower and the bull thistle and the coreopsis with the greatest respect.</p>
		
       	<p class="right-aligned" id="asterix"><em>***</em></p>
		<p>Teach the children.<br>We don’t matter so much, <br>but the children do.</p> <p>Show them daisies and the pale hepatica. Teach&nbsp;them&nbsp;the taste of&nbsp;sassafras and wintergreen. The&nbsp;lives of&nbsp;the&nbsp;blue sailors, mallow, sunbursts, the&nbsp;moccasin-flowers. And the frisky ones&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;inkberry, lamb’s-quarters, blueberries. And the aromatic ones;&mdash;&#8202;rosemary, oregano. </p><p>Give them peppermint to put in their pockets as&nbsp;they go to school. Give them the fields and&nbsp;the&nbsp;woods and the possibility of the world salvaged from the lords of&nbsp;profit.</p> <p>Stand them in&nbsp;the stream, head them upstream, rejoice as&nbsp;they learn to love this green space they live in,&nbsp;its sticks and leaves and then the silent, beautiful blossoms.</p>
